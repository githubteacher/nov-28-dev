# Github for Developers

## Hanover NH

Goal for Day 1:


`Issues`: discussion about something doesn't work, e.g. update, and then solutions

`Pull Requests`: related to Gitter; actual conversation of work being done (to resolve an issue)

`GitHub Pages`: static page based on a repo

Work history: commits
`[]` is a checkbox

GitHub workflow:
* Helps you & your team
* especially important if you're developer

Review: Github configuration
`git config --global user.name "Matt Desmond"`
`git config --global user.email`

To check your configurations:
`git config --list`

To reset your configurations to default:
`git config --`
